I am a computer engineering student in TU Delft. I am attracted to this field for two major reasons:

1. The opportunity to develop useful products for society
2. Facing challenging tasks & demands to learn continuously.

I have 3 years of experience working as a software developer specializing in Java and back-end application. My passion lies in creating softwares, understanding details and maximize the potential of hardware, acquiring new knowledge, and working collectively with people.

In addition, I also share an intense interest in running and hiking. Challenging and constant drives to push to the limit are two main reasons on why I love these activities.
