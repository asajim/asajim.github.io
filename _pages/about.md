I am a 26 years old, 2nd year master student in TU Delft, The Netherlands, majoring in computer engineering. I specialize in Information Technology for two major reasons:

1. The opportunity to develop useful products for society, and
2. Facing challenging tasks & demands to learn continuously.

I have 3 years of experience working as a software developer specializing in Java and desktop-server application. My passion lies in creating softwares, acquiring new knowledge, and working collectively with people.
